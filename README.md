# Daily Code Practice Repository 📘💻

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I practice coding challenges daily to sharpen my skills and expand my knowledge! 🚀 I tackle problems in various areas, including data structures, algorithms, Python, SQL, and more. I invite you to explore and learn along with me.

Feel free to navigate through the folders to find different topics and practice problems. Each folder contains solutions and explanations for coding problems I've worked on. 📝

## 📅 Daily Progress

I strive to solve at least one problem each day as part of my **365 Days of Code Challenge** with Scaler. You can track my progress here and follow along on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-kumaresh/) where I post updates on the challenge regularly.
